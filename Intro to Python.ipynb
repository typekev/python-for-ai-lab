As a high-level language, Python is also far-removed from the challenges associated with lower-level programming languages (such as assembly languages), making it much easier to learn.\n",

In programming, when we talk about [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_(computer_science)) we are often concerned about what is [_syntactically_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)) _valid_ in a given language. So then, what's considered \"syntactically valid\" in Python. For instance, if I wanted to write a small Python program that would just display the text \"Hello, world!\" on my screen, what would that look like?\n",

Let's consider why this matters, and how imperative programming relates to the code block we just executed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, consider what \"imperative programming\" means. Imperative languages are based on statements, and those statements determine the [flow of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow) within a program. A statement that controls something? That probably sounds familiar, often we call these **instructions**, you can think of statements as instructions or micro instructions if you like. All actions within an imperative program are caused by, and only only occur because of, a given statement which produced the action. In other words, the program is strictly controlled by instructions.\n",
